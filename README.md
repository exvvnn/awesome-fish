## Awesome Fish! 🐟
***

Welcome to my list of helpful fish functions I have created in my time using fish! Source them from you config file in you fish directoy!
In the future I will create a helpful python function that will help add them to your path, and to your `config.fish` file. 

If you have questions please feel free to post them under Issues. Please do not troll my site. 
Thanks!
